##why use pandas 
#(show website)
    1. easy to manipulate large datasets
    2. easy to upload large datasets (once script base is written)
    3. IMO - script folder (python project) structure easier to GIT for version control
    4. easy to use just the pieces you need (KISS principle)

##How to get pandas (conda)
#####install Anaconda tooling 
#(show anaconda python website)
1. easy to maintain python virtual environments
2. use multiple version of python
3. simple and easy install taking care of all the path requirements etc.

### *Learn The Moves*

- [ ] Simple Structure - Series
    1. Series - Arrary with and index
    2. Indexing
    3. Enumeration
    4. Filtering (talk about list comprehenshions in python list)
        a. inline
        b. lambdas
        c. numpy mask
        d. tilde operator

    5. Changing values
        a. by index
        b. by filter
 - [ ] Compled Structure - Data Frame
    1. Data Frame - multiple Arrays/Series with an index
    2. Indexing
    3. Enumeration - iterrows() - column values by name and index
    4. Filtering
        a. inline
        b. lambdas
        c. numpy mask
        d. tilde operator

    5. Changing values
        a. by index
        b. by filter
